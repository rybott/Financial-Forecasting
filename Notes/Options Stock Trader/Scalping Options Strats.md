# Strategy Zero - Nike Trigger
- Only analyze the stock data if the Nike Trigger is pulled
- Nike Trigger
	- Look at the last 4 period closing price
	- Call the candles 4,3,2,1 with 4 being the oldest candle
	- 4 and 2 must be greater than 3
	- 1 must be greater than 4
	- Makes a Swoosh 
- This will tell me when it is even worth looking at the trend analysis

# Strategy One - Based on Options Data
- Look at the analysis of the stock
- Must be same week options
- If you think the stock will go up from there
	- Look for the contract with the strike price closest to the current stock price
	- Look for a very tight bid ask spread
	- Look for the highest open interest
	- Buy the Call

# Strategy Two - Based on Stock Data
## Trend Lines
- Look at the 8 period and 5 period EMA, and then 13 EMA. 
- If all three are moving up it is an uptrend 
- If the 8 and 5 are moving away from the 13 that is a stronger uptrend
- VV for downtrend
